<div><p>The name parrot refers to various species of mostly arboreal birds that form the order Psittaciformes , which is divided 
into 3 families: Cockatoos (Cacatuidae), Psittacidae (Psittacidae) and Strigopidae . There are currently 386 classified species 
of parrots, belonging to 88 genera.</p></div>

<div><p>They are found on all continents of the world, although in Europe there is no endemic species, although some species have been 
reported as feral in many European countries. [ 2 ] Parrots are also completely absent from the Antarctic region . In Greece they are 
known since the time of Alexander the Great , when for the first time he and men from his expeditionary force brought parrots. This species 
is called the " Alexandrian parakeet ". [ 3 ] As for the USA, there one may encounter the Carolina Parakeet ( Conuropsis carolinensis ) or 
the thick-billed parakeet, although these species are not endemic there.</p></div>
