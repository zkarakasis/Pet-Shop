<div><p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales.[1] 
The name Corgi is of Welsh origin, and is a compound of the words cor and ci (mutated to gi), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", 
respectively.[a] It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi, the other being the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. 
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are descended from the Spitz family of dog.</p></div>

<div><p>Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who owned more than 30 Royal corgis during her reign.
[2] Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public they have recently 
fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.[3] However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities such as 
New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco hold annual "Corgi Meetups" in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate 
to spend the day.[4]</p></div>

<div><p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that the breed 
is considered an excellent working dog. Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 11th most popular breed of dog in 2020 according 
to the American Kennel Club.[5]</p></div>
