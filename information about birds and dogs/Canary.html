<div><p>The canary is a songbird of the ratite order and belongs to the finch family (Fringillidae). The official name of the domesticated 
canary is sirinus canaria domesticus.Canaries were introduced to Spain in the 15th century after the Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands.
Due to a shipping accident, a large shipment of canaries escaped and soon spread throughout Europe. 
The canary is also likely to have originated from the wild canary ( serinus canaria canaria ), 
which is native to the Canary Islands of Madeira , the Azores , Tenerife </p></div>
