<div><p>Falcons are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, 
narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely distributed on 
all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.</p></div>

<div><p>Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, 
in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose 
bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults.</p></div>
