<div><p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf.
Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
hunter-gatherers.Dogs were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago,before the development of agriculture. 
Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be 
inadequate for other canids.Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities,and physical attributes. 
Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), 
powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans,
dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as 
hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p></div>

<div><p>The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog.
It is a stocky, muscular dog of medium size, with a large head, thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a 
relatively flat face with a protruding lower jaw. Selective breeding for appearance has led to increased susceptibility 
to various health problems including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia and heat sensitivity. The dogs may not be bred in the 
Netherlands, because of concerns about their quality of life.</p></div>

<div><p>The modern Bulldog was bred as a companion dog from the Old English Bulldog, a now-extinct breed used for bull-baiting 
until that was outlawed under the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835. The Bulldog Club (in England) was formed in 1878, and the 
Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890. While often used as a symbol of ferocity and courage, the modern Bulldog is generally
a friendly, amiable dog. It is commonly kept as a pet; in 2013 it was the twelfth-most-frequently registered breed worldwide.</p></div>

<div><p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales.[1] 
The name Corgi is of Welsh origin, and is a compound of the words cor and ci (mutated to gi), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", 
respectively.[a] It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi, the other being the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. 
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are descended from the Spitz family of dog.</p></div>

<div><p>Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who owned more than 30 Royal corgis during her reign.
[2] Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public they have recently 
fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.[3] However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities such as 
New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco hold annual "Corgi Meetups" in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate 
to spend the day.[4]</p></div>

<div><p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that the breed 
is considered an excellent working dog. Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 11th most popular breed of dog in 2020 according 
to the American Kennel Club.[5]</p></div>

<div><p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded theropod dinosaurs constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers, 
toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong 
yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m 
(9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 44 orders.More than half 
are passerine or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups 
without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, 
although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic 
island species.The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of 
aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.The study of 
birds is called ornithology.</p></div>

<div><p>The peacock or peafowl (scientific Latin: Pavo , Greek: taos ) is a bird of the pheasant family, of the order of the ornithiformes. 
It originates from the forests of South India . It came to Europe in antiquity and was domesticated in an unknown way. It was known in Mesopotamia
,Ancient Greece and Rome . It was believed that it was protected by the Gods and it was common to find it in temples and courtyards of wealthy 
houses. Today in India the peacock is a protected species.</p></div>

<div><p>The peacock exhibits strong sexual dimorphism , as the male has a different appearance from the female . 
The male is 1.25 m long . without its tail, which doubles its length. Its color is green or blue on the chest, belly and head,
it has short wings that allow it limited flight and a crest on the top of the head. It has a very impressive tail with long rudder 
feathers with green , blue , black and orange eye-like spots, which it opens in a fan shape.</p></div>

<div><p>The name parrot refers to various species of mostly arboreal birds that form the order Psittaciformes , which is divided 
into 3 families: Cockatoos (Cacatuidae), Psittacidae (Psittacidae) and Strigopidae . There are currently 386 classified species 
of parrots, belonging to 88 genera.</p></div>

<div><p>They are found on all continents of the world, although in Europe there is no endemic species, although some species have been 
reported as feral in many European countries. [ 2 ] Parrots are also completely absent from the Antarctic region . In Greece they are 
known since the time of Alexander the Great , when for the first time he and men from his expeditionary force brought parrots. This species 
is called the " Alexandrian parakeet ". [ 3 ] As for the USA, there one may encounter the Carolina Parakeet ( Conuropsis carolinensis ) or 
the thick-billed parakeet, although these species are not endemic there.</p></div>

<div><p>Falcons are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, 
narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely distributed on 
all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.</p></div>

<div><p>Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, 
in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose 
bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults.</p></div>
