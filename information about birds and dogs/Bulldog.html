<div><p>The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog.
It is a stocky, muscular dog of medium size, with a large head, thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a 
relatively flat face with a protruding lower jaw. Selective breeding for appearance has led to increased susceptibility 
to various health problems including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia and heat sensitivity. The dogs may not be bred in the 
Netherlands, because of concerns about their quality of life.</p></div>

<div><p>The modern Bulldog was bred as a companion dog from the Old English Bulldog, a now-extinct breed used for bull-baiting 
until that was outlawed under the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835. The Bulldog Club (in England) was formed in 1878, and the 
Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890. While often used as a symbol of ferocity and courage, the modern Bulldog is generally
a friendly, amiable dog. It is commonly kept as a pet; in 2013 it was the twelfth-most-frequently registered breed worldwide.</p></div>
